# Finishing Projects

As a dev, starting a new project is as easy as it is exciting. I've gone through the process of `git init` and putting yet another soon-to-be-abandoned repo on my github so many times I could do it in my sleep. But why do I and many other devs struggle ever finishing any of them?

Finishing my recent medium-sized project has given me some insights as to why it's such a struggle for me, so I decided to share them here. Maybe what I learned resonates with you. Will knowing **why** help with the **how**? I'm afraid I have to disappoint there. Even with these insights, I don't forsee a future where I'm releasing finished products left and right, but maybe I'll feel a little less guilty about adding to my graveyard of projects that all started with the best of intentions.

This isn't a long article. So you and me both can get back to running `git init` before you know it.

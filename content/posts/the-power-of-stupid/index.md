Being a software engineer has many perks. When people learn you are one, most assume you're a pretty smart cookie.

> That is not one of the perks.

# The Being Smart Trap

We all like to think of ourselves as *"smart"*. And if you're like most people, you feel embarrassed when you do something that doesn't align with being a *"smart"* person. We have an idea what a *"smart"* person is and we get it all mixed up.

If you've ever said "There's no such thing as a stupid question" and meant it, think about this: Was there *any* question the person could have asked that would make you think less of them? And when you hesitate to ask a question yourself, do you hold yourself to that same standard?

# Two Very Different Software Engineers

I've had the pleasure of working with many different kinds of software engineer, but over the course of my career, two stand out to me.

## Engineer One

Engineer One always asked questions. They asked questions before they got stuck, they asked more questions when they got stuck, and they asked even more after someone helped them get unstuck. They second-guessed themself constantly and asked for feedback on their ideas before writing the first line of code. They got things wrong, and when they did, they completely owned up to mistakes. And when things went right, they were quick to point out it was a team effort.

%% TODO: Determine whether to leave this part in
We got into a heated argument over a feature once. To everyone else in the office, it must have looked like we were fighting. After one of us won that discussion (it does not matter who), they went on the team Slack channel to post about how they enjoy discussions like that and how much they appreciate their ideas being challenged.

They were not afraid to look stupid.

## Engineer Two

Another engineer at a different job was quite the opposite. They seemed to work based on an assumption they were never wrong. They didn't ask questions, they just wrote the first code that came to their mind. Often the code they wrote was inefficient, badly formatted, reinvented wheels badly, or straight up didn't work or make sense. Any PR comment with genuine improvements was frequently replied to with "that's a personal preference, won't fix". And when they finally had to concede and make the suggested changes in the code, they frequently turned to badmouthing existing code and the engineers who wrote it. When they felt like they couldn't elevate how smart people perceived them through their work, they turned to undermining others and their work.

We got into a heated argument over code reviews once. To everyone else in the zoom meeting, it must have looked like we were fighting. Looking back, I guess we were.

They were terrified of looking stupid.



# Scratch Pad

When was the last time someone asked you a question so basic that you thought less of them?

Imagine the most senior engineer you know, someone you actually look up to, coming to you asking for something basic. "How do I solve a merge conflict?". Would you not look up to them anymore?

I went on a solo trip to Marseille to improve my French. I comitted to speaking only French during the trip. Every time I left my hotel room, I said to myself "Time to go looking like an idiot" and forced myself to be okay with that.

My first dev manager told me: It's my job to make you a better developer. I now think it's MY job to make me a better developer. It's my manager's job to show me the way. But then I outgrew my managers. So what's their job now?
